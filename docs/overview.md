# Overview

`feathers-fletching` is a collection of useful [Feathers hooks](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/hooks.html).

If you are not familiar with Feathers or hooks, head over to the [Feathers guide](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/) to get an idea how to quickly and easily build real-time applications and REST APIs.

This library is heavily inspired by `feathers-hooks-common`, `feathers-plus`, and many others. Thanks to all of the great Feathers community and maintainers!

This documentation has several parts:

- [Hooks API](./hooks.md) - The API for the available hooks
- [Plugins API](./plugins.md) - The API for the available plugins
- [Utilities API](./utilities.md) - The API for the available utility methods

To get started
